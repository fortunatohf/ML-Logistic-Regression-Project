# ML-Logistic-Regression-Project

I use the sklearn module to apply logistic regression model to an advertising dataset. In this project I work with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. The model will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
